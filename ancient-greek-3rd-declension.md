Mounce's "Noun Rules" BBG pp. 87 and

1. Stems ending in alpha or eta are in the first declension,
stems ending in omicron are in the second, and
consonantal stems are in the third. The declension of a
noun affects only its form, not its meaning.
2. Every neuter word has the same form in the nominative
and accusative.
3. Almost all neuter words end in alpha in the nominative
and accusative plural.
4. In the dative singular, the iota subscripts if possible.
γραφη + ι → γραφῇ. This rule explains what happens to the dative
singular case endings in the first and second declension. An iota
can subscript only under a long vowel.
5. Vowels often change their length (“ablaut”).
λογο + ι → λογῷ. “Ablaut” is the technical term for this. By
“change their length” I mean that they can shorten (omega to
omicron), lengthen (omicron to omega) as in the dative singular, or
disappear entirely.8
6. In the genitive and dative, the masculine and neuter will always be identical.
7. The Square of Stops
• Labials + sigma form psi; velars plus sigma form xi; dentals plus
sigma form sigma.
• The ντ combination drops out when followed by sigma (παντ + ς
→ πᾶς).
• Whatever happens in the nominative singular third declension
also happens in the dative plural. σαρκ + σ → σάρξ. σαρκ + σι
→ σαρξί.
8. A tau cannot stand at the end of a word and will drop off.
• When no case ending is used in stems ending in -ματ, the tau
drops out. ὀνοματ + – → ὀνοματ → ὄνομα.

# 3rd Koine/Attic Declension

The third declension does not have a stem vowel, as the first (α/η) and second (ο) declensions do. The third declension is more prone to contractions and other irregularities than the other two.

[m141, s4228]  ὁ πούς; τοῦ ποδός -- s3m

* ds and np are not attested to in NT

Endings seem to be:  
(stem-from gs +)  
--         -ες  
--         -ῶν  
(δ→σ) -ῐ́   -σῐ́(ν)  
-ᾰ         -ᾰς  
"voc-as-nom"  

## 1st Declension

• If the stem ends in εα, ια, or ρα, it is formed like ὥρα, -ας
• If the stem ends in a sibilant and alpha (σα, ξα, ζα), it is
formed like δόξα, -ης.
• All other feminine words are formed like γραφή, -ῆς
