# Lucian pronuncian of koine Greek

- Half-way between ancient and modern
- It attempts to correct Erasmian pronunciation — common amongst scholars of the New Testament — a phonology that is not attested to in antiquity, and that some modern Greek speaker find culturally insensitve.
- The phonology is derived from the sounds found in Ancient Greek from about the 2nd Century AD.
- Most qualities are the same as in Modern Greek.
- It retains the phonemic distinction between short and long vowels.

## short vowels

|||
|--- |---    |---
| α  |  /a/  |  ἄοκνος
| ε  |  /e̞/  |  ἔχω
| ι  |  /i/  |  ἴσως
| o  |  /o̞/  |  ὀπός
| υ  |  /y/  |  λύκος

## long vowels

- These were not marked in the Greek.

- Difference are in quantity (the sounds are held for longer) than in quality.

|--- |---     |---
| ᾱ  |  /aː/  |  ἄγαν (ἄγᾱν άγααν)
| η  |  /e̞ː/  |  ἔτη
| ει |  /iː/  |  εἶπον
| ῑ  |  /iː/  |  ἀποκρίνεται (αποκρί̄νεται)
| ω  |  /o̞ː/  |  κώμη
| ου |  /uː/  |  οὐδαμῶς
| ῡ  |  /yː/  |  δείκνυμι (δείκνῡμι)

> 💡
> ει /iː/ and ῑ /iː/ have merged completely.

## true dipthongs

- Lucian Pronunciation also has two true diphthongs.
- The first is a transition between /a/ and /e/
- The second is a transition from /ø/ to /y/

|---  |---     |---
| αι  |  /ae̯̞/  |  κόραι
| οι  |  /øy̯/  |  οἴμοι

> 💡
> As /y/ is a rounded /i/, so /ø/ is a rounded /e/
