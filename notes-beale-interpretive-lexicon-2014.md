# Notes on Beale's Interpretive Lexicon of Prepositions, Adverbs etc

A running vocab, really...

## Introduction

- Definitions of words are taken from *A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature* by Walter Bauer et al.

- Prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, particles, and relative pronouns: all these parts of speech indicate relationships between clauses andare therefore integral to conveying and supporting a main idea in communication.

- The lexicon is intended as an aid for discerning logical relationships between propositions in order to enhance exegesis.

- This Lexicon is by no means an exhaustive guide to meaningful relationships between propositions, which occur with or without connecting words to signal them. It is only an attempt to categorize the relationships ordinarily represented by a given word when such a word appears in the text.

First, clause relationships are merely signaled by words, since words themselves are not what create or contain semantic relationships.

### Some terminology

- **postpositive** -- occurs immediately after that which it modifies.
- **apodosis** -- is the main clause in a conditional sentence, expressing the logical consequent. E.g. 'it will be hot' in "If the sun is shining, *it will be hot*."

## Particles

- **ἄρα** -- So, then, consequently, as a result. -- Introduces the apodosis of a clause/ conditional sentence.

- δέ -- (postpositive)

## Conjunctions

- ἀλλά
- γάρ
- καί

## Prepositions

## Adverbs

οὗν -- (because of this) **then** that after this.

## Relative pronouns
