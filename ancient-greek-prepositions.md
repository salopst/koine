## 2022-07-01 Prepositional interlude

|S575  | **ἀπό** ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ "deliver us from [the] evil" [Matt 6:13]
|S1537 | **ἐκ, ἐξ** gen
(ek) has a two-layered meaning ("out from and to") which makes it out-come oriented (out of the depths of the source and extending to its impact on the object). Often `of` in the KJV. ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν "from Heaven[s]" [Matt 3:17]
|S| **πρός**
|S| **ὑπό**

In general, the prepositions are used to indicate the location or motion of a noun or pronoun and are infleced according to case. Three cases are used that broadly signify:

- accusative - motion toward/in to
- dative     - location up/under/side-by-side
- genetive   - location from/out of

- **Proclitic**s *lean* on the word that follows for their accent
- Three prepositions are proclitic; they are unaccented:
  - ἐν    - "in, on, among"
  - ἐκ/ἐξ - "out from"
  - εἰς   - "into"
