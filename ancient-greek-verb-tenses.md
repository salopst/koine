- Tenses are more about the state of the action rather than time per se. That is are they compelted, or are they in progress. So the imprerfect (incomplete action) is based onthe present stem, for example
- Most common are present, then aorist, followed by imperfect, then future.
- Present is bare stem
- Imperfect has augment at front, usually an ε
- Future adds an σ ς to the root stem
- Aorist adds an σα to the root stem
- perfect reduplicates front of the root stem
- 6 PRINCIPAL PARTS:
  present, future, aorist active, perfect active, perfect mediopassive, aorist passive
- E.g λύω, λύσω, ἔλυσα, λἐλυκα, λέλυμαι, ἐλὺθην
- Perfect active adds κα to end of the root stem
- Aorist passive adds θη to end of the root stem
- Future passive adds sigma to end of θη... θησ/ς

# Attic / Koine Greek Verb tenses

## Greek imperfect tense

PIA: εἰμῐ́, εἶ,   ἐστί(ν) || ἐσμέν, ἐστέ, εἰσί(ν)
IIA: ἦ(ν), ἦσθα, ἦν      || ἦμεν,  ἦτε,  ἦσαν

The imperfect tense is roughly equivalent to the English progressive tense. It is past time, internal aspect. Imperfects always take an augment but never a tense formative.

present – I walk;     imperfect – I was walking

cf. PIA: παύω, παύεις, παύει || παύομεν, παύετε, παύουσῐ(ν)

IIA:
ἔπαυον    || ἐπαύομεν
ἔπαυες    || ἐπαύετε
ἔπαυε(ν)  || ἔπαυον

ε prefix, kill ω, then:
-ον, -ες, -ε, -ομεν, -ετε, -ον
