# Ancient Greek Alphabet and Pronunciation

Didn't the Ancient Greeks have ANY kind of stress accent at all?

Actually, it sounds like Japanese. Japanese has pitch changes but no stress accent.

From Greek - An Intensive Course (Chapter 1.10 pg. 6)
> Most Greek words had one syllable whose musical pitch varies slightly from that of other syllables. Such a syllable is said to be accented, and this difference in pitch is called the words accent. In English, accent is show by an increased stress on the accented syllable (e.g., relative, religious, reconstruct, rather than a difference in musical pitch. Unlike written English, written Greek marks accents wherever they occur.
> Greek indicates accent in the following ways:
>
> ´ Acute accent - Marks a rise in musical pitch
> ` Grave accent - Marks a lowering of pitch or substitution of a steady for a raised pitch
> ~ Circumflex Accent - Marks a raising and lower of pitch in the same syllable

If you are not going to be composing music in ancient greek or study ancient greek music and you are a newbie in the language, pitch accent might not be the best thing to focus your energies on.
