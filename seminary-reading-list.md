## Apologetics

### Geisler, Christian Apologetics

Theism, then, is a logical prerequisite to Christianity. What is more, an adequate
test for truth is a methodological prerequisite to establishing theism. For unless the Christian
apologist has a test by which he can show other systems to be false and theism to be true, there is no
way to adjudicate the conflicting claims of various religions and worldviews.

## New Testament Exegesis

### Blomberg and Markley, A Handbook of New Testament Exegesis
