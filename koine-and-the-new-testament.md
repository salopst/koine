# Koine and the New Testament (Ἡ Κοινή Διαθήκη)

## Books of the New Testament

-Καινὴ or Κοινή.

- The use of the phrase "New Testament" (Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη, Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē) to describe a collection of first and second-century Christian Greek scriptures can be traced back to Tertullian in his work Against Praxeas

- Learning Attic is very useful for religious students as well. Many Fathers of the Church studied the ancient authors and wrote in a rather atticized koine.

- If you really only want to read the New Testament, or perhaps the Septuagint, Koine is slightly simpler and you might as well learn it directly. There are some great recent textbooks (e.g. by Decker, Schwant and others).

- Do not start with Modern Greek. They are mutually incomprehensible, separate languages, with different grammars and different vocabularies.

- The writers were strongly influenced by Hebrew and Aramaic, in which the verb is placed first in the sentence and is often accompanied by particles, in Greek δέ and καί, which may also stand before the verb.

### Pronunciation / orthography

**homonyms** same pronunciation, different orthography. `beet` vs `beat`
**Phonemic** refers to the sounds of a language that make a distinction in meaning.

- `Stop` and `top` pronounced differently. These differences do not have phonemic meaning in English. They are **etic** (different sounds no semantic meaning) NOT **emic** (different sounds have semantic meaning).
- /tʰ/ in `top`
- /t/ in `stop`
- (initial) rho always takes rough breathing... ρἁββι ?? "r" is a kinda vowel, maybe??

- Accent was pitch-based, not stress (English).
- ή for the οκσεῖα 'acute' accent or high pitch
- ῆ for the περισπώμενον accent or high-low pitch
- ὴ for the βαρεῖα 'grave' or falling pitch.

| αι       | ai        |          | eye    | |
| ει       | ei        | /i/      | h*ay*  | |

| ου       | ou        |          | h*oo*p | |
| ευ / ηυ  | eu        |          | f*eu*d | |

/i/ == m*ee*, but short
/aː/ == h*ay* -- Erasmian

Essential changes from Erasmian to Lucian...
Nice reading from Xenophon at the end: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ponGrCwjYWo>
ει → /iː/
ζ  → /zː/
β  → /β/ or /v/
δ  → /ð/
γ  → /ɣ~ʝ/

 if η is pronounced like h**ay** then clashes with ει dipthong. So

Some Latin words with [v,w] transcribed in Greek with [β].  Historically, the Latin sound was transcribed with ου in Greek.

πρεβέτοις        for the Latin [privatus] (1st century CE)

Φλαβία            for the Latin [Flavia] (149 CE)

Φλαουβίου  and  Φλαυβίας         for the Latin [Flavius/-a] (120 CE)

Suggests ου should be like Spanish `v`/ English `f`
